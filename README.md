# xperience

**THIS IS NOT A FINISHED/FUNCTIONING PROJECT**

This is my project from my Spring 2025 Software and Systems Security course.

We developed an xperience server that stored event data into a SQL database.

I do not like having unfinished projects on my GitHub, but I feel like keeping this one up
just to show my learning experience throughout being a student.
